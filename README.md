# Chess
This project allows you to play Chess in the terminal using Java.

To move a piece you must type in the current location of the piece on the board, and then the location where you would like it to move to. Any illegal move will result in the same player being asked to move again.

All rules of traditional chess are implemented including: Check, Checkmate, Stalemate, Castling, Enpassant and Promotion.

Resignation: If a player wishes to resign and concede the win, they can simply type "resign" when they are prompted to make a move on their turn and the other player automatically wins.

Draw: If a player wishes to draw, they can type in "draw" when they are prompted to make a move on their turn. The other player may accept or reject the offer, "y" to accept and "n" to decline. The game will continue on in the appropriate manner.

Undo: You may undo the previous move by typing "undo" into the terminal on the next player's turn. There are unlimited number of undos throughout the whole game.

AI: If you are playing by yourself, you may prompt the computer to make a move by typing "ai" when it is the other player's turn.
